# MapReduceDesignPatters_Pyspark

This repository will consist of exercises/or design patters discussed in the Map Reduce Design Patters by O'Reilly.
The book has code in Java, and here I am trying to cover *hopefully* all patterns using
311 NYC data and Pyspark.

Data can be found [here](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data)
