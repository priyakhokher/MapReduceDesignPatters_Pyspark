# MapReduceDesignPatters_Pyspark

This repository will consist of exercises/or design patters discussed in the Map Reduce Design Patters by O'Reilly.
The book has code in Java, and here I am trying to cover *hopefully* all patterns using
311 NYC data and Pyspark.

Data can be found [here](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/data)

A note is that - the data has many columns, while I might be using varying data fields for varying functions.
Also Spark is sensitive to missing data - so I have filtered accordingly.
Each pattern has a data folder to let you know how the fields look for the specific field.
